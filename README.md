# Code Showcase
This repository is a small selection of beginner-level Python projects
that I've been working on in my free time over the past year or so.

It primarily serves as a showcase of my current coding skills for application purposes.

The main goal I had when creating these projects was simply to have fun while learning the basic concepts of the Python programming language.
